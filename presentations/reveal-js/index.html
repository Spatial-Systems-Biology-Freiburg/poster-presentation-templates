                        ## Interesting Facts about Linux
                        - Created in 1991 as private project of Linus Torvalds
                        - Strictly speaking only the kernel (core of operating system)
                        - Written in C (Brian Kernighan, Dennis Ritchie in 1978)
                        - GNU Project by Richard Stallman provided GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) and many other utilities
                        - In General: Many Free/Open Source programs to run on Linux kernel

						## Distributions
						- Packages applications to create whole operating system
						- Package-Manager responsible for managing installed applications
						- Can be very specialized
							- Servers (Facebook, Google, Amazon, Almost every website, ...)
							- Docker-Containers (github workflows, gitlab continous integration, ...)
							- Embedded Devices (smart fridge, toaster, baby-cam, ...)
							- Supercomputers (2015 >95%, 2020 100% of top 500)
							- Network Infrastructure (router, network switch, ...)
							- Mobile Phones (android, pinephone, ...)
							- Mars Helicopter
							- ...
						- Often has very particular philosophical and technical viewpoints

						## Popular Distributions
						- Debian (1993) Servers, Personal Computers, known for stability<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- Ubuntu (2004) based on Debian, developed by company Canonical, newer packages at small loss of stability<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- RedHat Enterprise Linux (2000) by company Red Hat, for power users and servers<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- OpenSuse (2005) Rolling-Release Model (no versions), general-purpose distro<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- ArchLinux (2002) Rolling-Release Model, KISS Principle: Keep it Simple and Stupid, highly customizable, very good documentation<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- Gentoo (2002) extremely customizable, every package needs to be compiled, only for experienced Linux Gurus, good documentation<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

						## My Recommendations
						| Distro | Comments |
						|--------|----------|
						| Debian<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> | Widely used (especially in universities), very stable, not the newest packages<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> |
						| Ubuntu-Derivative<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> | more recent packages, not as stable as Debian, large userbase<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> |
						| Fedora<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> | Derivative from RedHat Enterprise Linux, used in workstations, overall very good performance, used by Linus Torvalds<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> |
						| Manjaro<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> | Derivative from ArchLinux but much more stable, rolling release (no versioned releases), very customizable<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> |

						---

						## Desktop Environments
						Not every Distro supports all Desktop Environments.<br>
						Sometimes one Distro has one DE.
						- KDE Plasma<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- Gnome: Cinnamon (Linux Mint), Unity (Ubuntu)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- Xfce<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- Lxde + LxQt<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

						## Text Editors
						### Command Line
						- Emacs (popular, highly extendable)
						- Vi(m) (completely different to traditional text editors)
						- Nano (very simple, only basic functionalities)

						---

						## Bash Commands 1
						```bash
						# Change to your home folder (absolute path)
						cd ~
						# List every file and directory in current directory
						ls
						# List also hidden files
						ls -a
						# List files starting with "Do"
						ls Do*
						# Change to the folder Documents (relative path, equivalent to /home/jonas/Documents in my case)
						cd ~/Documents
						# Create directory with name biology_is_nice
						mkdir biology_is_nice
						# Create empty file with name and_physics_too
						touch and_physics_too.txt
						```

						---

						## Bash Commands 2
						```bash
						# Find out which shell you are currently using (Environment Variable)
						echo $SHELL
						# Read the manual of the program grep
						man grep
						# Search for example
						/example
						# Show all possible commands (press h) then quit with q or Ctrl+C
						# Paste the content of your clipboard to the command line (Ctrl+Shift+V)
						# Instead of deleting everything interrupt the command with Ctrl+C
						# Print current working directory
						pwd
						```

						---

						## Bash Commands 3.1
						```bash
						# Output the text "1+1=3" to the console
						echo 1+1=2
						# Do an actual calculation and print the result
						echo $((1+1))
						# Store a value in a variable
						RESULT=$((1+3))
						# Output that variable
						echo $RESULT
						# Store the current working directory in a variable
						DIR=$(pwd)
						echo $DIR
						```

						----

						## Bash Commands 3.2
						```bash
						# List information on your operating system
						uname -a
						# List all usb devices
						lsusb
						# List all disks (hard-drive, ssd, usb-storage, ...)
						sudo fdisk -l
						# List all PCI Devices (graphics card, network adapter, ...)
						lspci
						```

						---

						## Bash Commands 4
						```bash
						# Write a for loop over all files/folders in the current directory where every element is printed with an appended "_output" string
						for name in $(ls);
						do
							echo $name"_output";
						done
						# Execute the last command again (press the "up" key)
						# Hint: You can do this multiple times, even going back with the "down" key
						# Generate a sequence of numbers
						seq 0 10
						# Write a for loop which prints all squares of the numbers from 0 to 10 (use the previously gained knowledge)
