# Very unofficial Template for Poster
## Example
Read the `poster.tex` file and experiment by yourself.
Also have a look at the example [poster.pdf](https://github.com/Spatial-Systems-Biology-Freiburg/poster-presentation-templates/tree/master/posters/latex/out/poster.pdf).

## How does it work?
This poster uses tikzposter and implements a custom theme around it.
There are multiple options which can be set.
I tried by best to document them in the source code.
Feel free to use but do not expect any help.
