  abstract = {Tissue morphogenesis requires the collective, coordinated motion and deformation of a large number of cells. Vertex model simulations for tissue mechanics have been developed to bridge the scales between force generation at the cellular level and tissue deformation and flows. We review here various formulations of vertex models that have been proposed for describing tissues in two and three dimensions. We discuss a generic formulation using a virtual work differential, and we review applications of vertex models to biological morphogenetic processes. We also highlight recent efforts to obtain continuum theories of tissue mechanics, which are effective, coarse-grained descriptions of vertex models. This article is part of the themed issue `Systems morphodynamics: understanding the development of tissue hardware'.},

  abstract = {We introduce an Active Vertex Model (AVM) for cell-resolution studies of the mechanics of confluent epithelial tissues consisting of tens of thousands of cells, with a level of detail inaccessible to similar methods. The AVM combines the Vertex Model for confluent epithelial tissues with active matter dynamics. This introduces a natural description of the cell motion and accounts for motion patterns observed on multiple scales. Furthermore, cell contacts are generated dynamically from positions of cell centres. This not only enables efficient numerical implementation, but provides a natural description of the T1 transition events responsible for local tissue rearrangements. The AVM also includes cell alignment, cell-specific mechanical properties, cell growth, division and apoptosis. In addition, the AVM introduces a flexible, dynamically changing boundary of the epithelial sheet allowing for studies of phenomena such as the fingering instability or wound healing. We illustrate these capabilities with a number of case studies.},

  abstract = {The evaluation of interactions between nearby particles constitutes the majority of the computational workload involved in classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this paper, we introduce a new method for the parallelization of range-limited particle interactions that proves particularly suitable to MD applications. Because it applies not only to pairwise interactions but also to interactions involving three or more particles, the method can be used for evaluation of both nonbonded and bonded forces in a MD simulation. It requires less interprocessor data transfer than traditional spatial decomposition methods at all but the lowest levels of parallelism. It gains an additional practical advantage in certain commonly used interprocessor communication networks by distributing the communication burden more evenly across network links and by decreasing the associated latency. When used to parallelize MD, it further reduces communication requirements by allowing the computations associated with short-range nonbonded interactions, long-range electrostatics, bonded interactions, and particle migration to use much of the same communicated data. We also introduce certain variants of this method that can significantly improve the balance of computational load across processors.},

Using a convenient and readily parallelizable block-based approach, different regions of the fluid are assigned differing time steps and solved at different rates to minimize computational cost. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve about two times speed-up over the standard method even in highly dynamic scenes.},

  abstract = {Colonies of bacteria,Bacillus subtilis, that grow on the surface of thin agar plates show various morphological patterns in response to environmental conditions, such as the nutrient concentration, the solidity of an agar medium and temperature. For instance, the colony pattern shows a dense-branching morphology with a smooth circular envelope (DBM-like) in a nutrient-poor semi-solid agar medium, and it turns to a simple disk-like colony as both the nutrient concentration and the agar's softness increase. These patterns have been shown to involve cell movement inside colonies. In a DBM-like colony, individual cells actively move, particularly in the expanding periphery of the colony, while they become immotile at the inner region of the colony where nutrient is very low. In a disk-like colony, cells are highly active in the whole region of the colony. Based on such experimental observations, we develop a diffusion-reaction model, in which density dependent cell movements are incorporated by the level of nutrient concentration available for the cell. Numerical simulations of the model under different environmental conditions closely reproduce various colony patterns ranging from DBM-like pattern to the homogeneous disk-like one in a unifying manner. The analysis also predicts the growth velocity of a colony as a function of the nutrient concentration.},
